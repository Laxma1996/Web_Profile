	<p>I am working as a .net and Angular js developer in a games team, where we are migrating the old web based application into new web application by using Angular js and also adding some features suggested, which helps in better usability for the clients. My work till date is assigned in this area. Application is all about storing the different types of data related to the games. We get the data from the third party. As clients need this data for analysis,we provide it with different forms like charts, graphs, with respect to rating and ranking, and also be able to compare one game with different games and many more.</p>
